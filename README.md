# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models with Hugging Face and TRL

This repository contains the code and resources for fine-tuning large language models using Hugging Face's Transformers library and the TRL (Text Representation Learner) library.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install -q accelerate==0.21.0 peft==0.4.0 bitsandbytes==0.40.2 transformers==4.31.0 trl==0.4.7
pip install huggingface_hub
## Fine-Tuning Process

1. **Installing and Importing Libraries:** Install the required libraries and import them into your script or notebook.

2. **Loading the Model:** Use `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained` to load the pre-trained model for fine-tuning.

3. **Loading the Tokenizer:** Use `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained` to load the tokenizer corresponding to the pre-trained model.

4. **Setting the Training Arguments:** Define the training arguments using `TrainingArguments`.

5. **Creating the Supervised Fine-Tuning Trainer:** Use `SFTTrainer` from the TRL library to create a trainer for supervised fine-tuning.

6. **Training the Model:** Use the `train` method of the trainer to start the fine-tuning process.
